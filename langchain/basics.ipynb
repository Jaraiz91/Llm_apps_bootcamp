    "In the last few weeks, I have seen the ultimate convergence of all things Marvel in Avengers: Endgame, watched the biggest TV Show in history (Game of Thrones) come to an end, and now - listened to the longest audiobook of my life in Oathbringer. I admit, I was much more excited for Endgame and Game of Thrones, but guess what? Oathbringer was the best, most satisfying experience of the three.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did that happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost 8 years ago, I began my journey with Brandon Sanderson in Mistborn. I tore through the paperbacks of that trilogy and desperately wanted more. I immediately ordered the hardback of The Way of Kings and....was immensely disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it is a BEAUTIFUL book. But the story was so...slow compared to Mistborn. It took me almost 3 years to finally get around to reading it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did, though, and although I was still confused by some of the complexity of it - I bought/read Words of Radiance when it came out in 2014. Now, THIS was more like it! Much more action, adventure, and awkward romance! Okay, so the awkward romance and dialogue wasn't my favorite, but I did love the story, and was so excited for Book 3!\n",
    "\n",
    "During the wait, however, I read a lot more. I discovered authors that were....different from Sanderson. Not necessarily better, per se, but different. I found myself listening to some of Brandon's critics. \"He can't write believable dialogue\", they said. \"His prose is too simple, and his language too modern.\" \"His sense of humor is childish.\" \"All of his characters share the same morality.\" And on, and on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I shouldn't have been so easily influenced, but I was. I found myself growing less and less excited about Oathbringer. So much so that when it released in 2017 - I didn't buy it. I didn't pay attention to everyone discussing it. I put it out of my mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have finally revisited The Cosmere. And friends? It was GLORIOUS*(spren).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Look, Oathbringer isn't perfect. There IS awkward dialogue. The prose CAN be simplistic. The pacing IS often slow. But GUYS - these criticisms pale in comparison to what Sanderson has accomplished with his characters, plotting, and world.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was genuinely moved by the journey Kaladin, Shallan, and now Dalinar continue to go through - their fight against the repercussion of past actions (leading to present mental illness) was utterly enthralling. As someone who himself struggles with anxiety and depression, I very much identify with Kaladin in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Also, I love the minor characters - ALL of them. For example, Jasnah was already my Queen - but now she's crowned and I am HERE FOR IT.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot steamrolled ahead in this book - way faster than the previous two. We got loads of new information that I am still trying to digest - and all of it makes me want to go back and read Way of Kings right now! I'm not sure how a book can succeed better than that, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, of course, there's Roshar. This feels like a real, breathing, place. I can think of very few a better-realized world in all of fiction. It is simply awe-inspiring. And I'm so grateful that, in Oathbringer, we actually get to see so much more of it.\n",
