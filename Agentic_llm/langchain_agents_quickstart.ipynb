This will be the first U.S. presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census.[24][25] If the results of the 2020 election were to stay the same (which has never occurred in the history of presidential elections) in 2024, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans\\' 235, a slight change from Biden\\'s 306 electoral votes and Trump\\'s 232, meaning that Democrats lost a net of 3 electoral votes to the reapportionment process.'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mDonald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.\u001b[0m\n",
